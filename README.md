ESP8266 Wifi Deauth IoT (Tested with ESP-01)

## WARNING
This device will block your entire 2.4 GHz WiFi environment with deauth packet injection.   
Please use it only for eductation and only for your own equipment.

## NOTE
I found the code in internet and did only add the user_interface.h from SDK.   
Be aware, that this code only works with Arduino IDE and "ESP8266 Community version 2.0.0"
